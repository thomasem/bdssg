[Back home](/) | [Back to recipes](/recipes)

Friends, have I got some news for **you**! It's time to make a stir fry.

Let's *GO*!

## Here are the *ingredients*

* sweet onions (a couple big ones)
* 12 oz **shiitake** mushrooms
* **extra-firm** tofu block x 2
* coconut aminos, *4 cups*
* orange juice, 1/2 cup
* garlic powder, 2 tsp
* ginger powder, 2 tsp
* toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp
* rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp
* arrowroot powder, 2 Tbsp
* broccoli crown x 2
* **high smoke-point** oil, such as olive or sunflower, 4 Tbsp, extra for baking tofu
* salt, 1/2 tsp
* pepper, 1/2 tsp

## Here are the *steps*

1. halve each tofu block horizontally and press all halves for 30m
2. cube tofu to desired size, marinade in 2 cups of aminos for about an hour, gently agitate the tofu half way through to make sure everything is soaked up
1. wash and slice the mushrooms, about 1/8" thick
1. peel, halve, and slice the onions into quarter-inch strips
3. wash and cut up the broccoli crowns into medium-sized florets (1.5-2" width)
1. preheat an oven to 400F
1. cover a baking sheet with foil and coat with a thin layer of oil
1. spread the marinated tofu out over a foil-covered baking sheet and brush with some extra oil to make sure they're coated
1. bake the tofu for 10-15 minutes until golden and crispy, but not burned - set aside
1. in a large pot, steam the broccoli florets in a basket for about 5 minutes and then set aside
1. heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat
1. once hot, add oil and let it heat up and start shimmering
1. add the mushrooms, onions, salt & pepper
1. toss these delicious veggies around for 6+ minutes and let them really soften and caramelize
1. add broccoli florets to the pan and let them get tender, kick around a few minutes
1. in a separate dish, whisk together the rest of the aminos with the orange juice, garlic powder, ginger powder, rice vinegar, and arrowroot powder
1. quickly add this mixture to the pan and stir frequently as the sauce thickens up over the next 4-5 minutes
1. serve over baked tofu, make sure the sauce gets a chance to coat the tofu


**Note**: consider serving with a starch, such as rice or noodles!

**Good job! Enjoy your stir fry.** :)
